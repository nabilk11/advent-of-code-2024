smallest from right - smallest from left

add up the differences

3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3


3 - 1 = 2
3 - 2 = 1
3 - 3 = 0
4 - 3 = 1
5 - 3 = 2
9 - 4 = 5

2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 11


two lists
sort each list in ascending order
map through each, subtracting the right list from the left, at each corresponding index
push each resultant difference into a 3rd array, and sum that array


PART 2


map through left array, 
identify frequency of left #, in right array,
multiply number by frequency and replace,
add all numbers
